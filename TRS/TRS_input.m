%TRS INPUT
%This is the input interface for TRS
%The structure of the function is
%[t dTE ttb RRmax X]=TRS(Q,RQ,DT,L,rw,b,K,ne,J,theta,rhocs,rhocw,ds,Dt,tend,PT,nPT)

%The outputs are:
%- t are the timesteps [d]
%- dTE is the temperature variation in the extraction well [K]
%- ttb is the thermal breakthrough time [d]
%- RRmax is the maximum recirculated flow rate fraction [-]
%- X is the thermal breakthrough parameter X=2Q/(pi*k*b*J*L) [-]

%The input parameters are:
%- Q is the flow rate [m3/s]
%- RQ is the reinjected flow rate fraction (values: 0รท1)
%- DT is the temperature difference [K] between the extraction 
%and the injection well (i.e. positive for cooling plants)
%- L is the well distance [m]
%- rw is the well radius [m]
%- b is the aquifer thickness [m]
%- K is the hydraulic conductivity [m/s]
%- ne is the effective porosity [-]
%- J is the hydraulic gradient in the aquifer [-]
%- theta is the hydraulic flow angle (radians measured counterclockwise
%from the conjunction line between extraction and injection well)
%- rhocs is the thermal capacity of the solid matrix of the soil [MJ/(m3K)]
%- rhocw is the thermal capacity of groundwater (usually 4.2 MJ/(m3K))
%- ds is the spatial step adopted for the calculation of the pathlines [m]
%- Dt is the time step adopted for the calculation of the water temperature[d]
%- tend is the final time for the calculation of the water temperature [d]
%- PT is the option for the particle pathlines to be plotted (PT=1) or not
%(PT=0)
%- nPT is the step for the particles pathlines to be skipped when plotting
%(e.g. nPT=3 means that one pathline on three will be plotted)
